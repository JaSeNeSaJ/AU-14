  description: These are an expensive pair of sunglasses. This brand is popular with UA foot sloggers because its patented mirror refraction has been said to offer protection from atomic flash, solar radiation, and targeting lasers. To top it all off, everyone seems to know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy that had a laser pistol reflect off of his shades.
