  - Players must be at least 17 years of age to play CMU. Players must be and act at least 17 years old or they will be banned until they are of age.

  - End of round grief of your own faction or other friendly parties is not permitted and results in an instant unappealable 3 hour ban.\nThis includes suicides without a valid roleplay reason.

  - No sexual act should ever be done or mentioned. Genitalia should never be given explicit description. Distasteful but non-sexual bravado do not apply to this so long as it is not directed towards another player. Euphemisms that also have a sexual meaning are allowed in non-sexual contexts. Common terms or phrases like “Suck my dick”, "Go fuck yourself", etc are fine, as long as saying such is not a literal invitation or solicitation to do so.
 
  - Romantic or non-platonic relationships (marriage, dating, engagement, etc) between two players are not allowed. This is not a dating server.
