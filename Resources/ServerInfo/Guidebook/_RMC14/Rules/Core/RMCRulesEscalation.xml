  ## Follow the rules of escalation.

  Follow escalation rules against non-hostiles and/or neutral groups. Don't instantly murder someone for annoying you, use common sense.

  - Always give verbal warnings before resorting to violence.
  - Only use the force required to incapacitate or disable the other person if they are from your faction.
  - You can defend yourself to the extent of protecting your own and others lives, if the attacker is not a hostile force.
  - MPs and Law Enforcement should use less-lethal force to effect arrests of criminals when lethal weapons are not in play.
  - Adminhelp the situation if you think someone is over-escalating.
