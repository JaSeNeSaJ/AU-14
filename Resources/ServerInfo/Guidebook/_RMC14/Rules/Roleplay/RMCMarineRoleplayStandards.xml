  # Military roleplay standards
  - A person with a "military role" is defined as any character apart of GOVFOR and/or OPFOR or currently apart of a uniformed force (Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, etc.) of an established nation (e.g., UA, TWE, UPP). CLF and other insurgents are not considered to be a military role, even if backed by a nation.
  - Don't openly try to cooperate with obvious or known hostile forces as a member of the opposite faction.
  - All personnel in military roles must be mentally stable and fit for duty. Some leeway may be provided when it comes to being mentally unstable. Characters may have PTSD and common mental issues, however it must not greatly effect your ability to function within the military. Military characters may never choose to commit suicide as a result of mental health issues.
  - All military roles should be following their role objectives and the orders of those above them.
  - Military correspondents, should primarily focus on reporting combat and engage in combat only in self-defense or to protect nearby fellow faction members.
  - Medical roles (excluding corpsmen/combat medics) should primarily focus on providing medical aid and engage in combat only in self-defense or to protect nearby fellow faction members.
