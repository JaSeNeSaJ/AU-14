  # Chain of Command

  The new commander of the operation does not assume a new rank, title or powers such as access changes, but other personnel must follow their orders that pertain to directing the operation.
  
  In CMU, the chain of command is determined by rank, with the highest-ranking character present assuming control. However, command authority is restricted to those who are part of the original deployment unit, meaning they must have spawned on the ship or in the base/garrison. If multiple characters of the same rank are present, the most senior character in terms of in-character experience and position will take command. Command may be delegated as necessary, but authority always defaults to the highest eligible ranking character.
