  # Xenomorph roleplay standards

  [bold]Unlike most other servers, Xenomorphs are held to the same MRP+ roleplay standard as all other roles on this server.[/bold]

  ## General
  - The Queen may banish and/or devolve xenonids who do not follow these rules.
  - Xenomorphs enact the will of the Queen and must follow her orders.\nThe Queen may not force a xeno to a specific caste.
  - They are not, and may never be friendly to lifeforms that are potential hosts, or threaten the hive.
  - The exception to this are synthetics, which Xenomorphs do not care for and must be ignored if safe to do so.
  - Banished Xenomorphs are exempt from hive protection and may be killed. It should be announced for clarity.

  [italic]Avoid seeking out enemies at the start of the round as a larva. Evolve before searching for them and bring allies, because [color=#ff0000]you will no longer protected by the early round timer[/color] should you die because you have left the protection of the hive.[/italic]

  ## Killing
  - Xenomorphs may kill anyone, anywhere, for any reason, provided it is not detrimental to the hive. (i.e killing someone who could easily be infected, or is infected.)
  - Xenomorphs may only harm nested hosts if given explicit permission by the queen, or at their own risk of the above rule if the queen is unresponsive.

  ## Language and speech
  - Xenomorph language is an english translation of their thoughts. They can define locations such as locations and ships, but do not know the names of them.
  - Do not spam the chat with noises.
  - Xenomorphs, due to the hivemind, learn everything and understand human equipment at a basic level.
  - They can understand a humans role.
  - Xenomorphs can sense ship(s) and/or the presence of other lifeforms. They are aware they may be attacked shortly.

  ## Queen
  - Do not draw unrelated pictures or write unrelated things on the map.
  - Do not give jellies to xenonids sarcastically or as a joke. These are permanent awards on a player's account for doing well as a character and should have effort put into them.
  - You are expected to have a level of professionalism in the role, similar to all other command roles.


  If you are a Xenomorph attacking a faction base or ship, [color=#ff0000]attacking newly spawned players in cryo before hijack is forbidden, let them have a chance to gear up before you attack them![/color] Avoiding the cryo or spawn rooms unless the humans are using them as cover will be enough.
