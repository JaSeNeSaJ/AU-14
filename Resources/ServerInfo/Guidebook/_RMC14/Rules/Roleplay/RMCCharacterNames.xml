  # Character Names

  [italic]Admin rulings on IC names are final and disputes should be done through the discord.[/italic]

  ## Use realistic names, avoid names of real people and characters
  - Pick a realistic name that could appear on a birth certificate with at least a first and last name.
  - No names or references of people or characters from the real world, alien franchies and/or other forms of popular media.
  - Names should not be written in all Caps Lock
  - No titles/ranks/honorifics. Titles, ranks and honorifics include but are not limited to; Dr/Doctor, Jr/Junior, Major.
  - Names must follow all other rules (no slurs/sexual names/etc)
  - Usernames, objects, random characters, very "low effort" names, "meta" names, or otherwise implausible names cannot be used as names.
  - Up to three characters of Roman numerals may be used in the place of a nickname.
  - A name comprised of extremely common names (I.E John Williams) can be excused for being shared with someone famous, provided the player is not attempting to imitate or overtly reference the linked person.

  ## Nicknames
  - They may be used in the format of, in single quotes, [bold]Firstname 'Nickname' Lastname[/bold].
  - Nicknames can be at most two words.

  ## Artificial Womb Soldiers
  [italic]These soldiers do not have any biological parents who have passed along their last name to them. Instead these soldiers have been assigned a regular first name, the AW initials as a middle name and a weapon as their surname.[/italic]
  - As an AW Soldier you MUST have a weapon as your last name. This weapon needs to have been used/developed before or during 2012 or earlier. (Vulcan, Sword, etc.)
  - The last name selected may not contain any numerical or hyphenated portions. For example; AA-12 would not be an acceptable last name but Javelin would be.
  - Your character may only be a Artificial Womb Soldier if they have a background pertaining to the United Americas. All AW soldiers were originally made for employment in the UA, but may have chosen not to enlist upon turning eighteen.
  - For example; James AW Vulcan
