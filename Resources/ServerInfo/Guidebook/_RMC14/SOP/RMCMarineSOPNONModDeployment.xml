  # NON-Modifiable Deployment Restrictions

  ## Commander Field Deployment

  - The [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] has the right to deploy to the frontline for the sake of commanding their personnel from a direct point of view. Deployments must be for the sake of the personnel and operation, and not for the personal glory of the [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color].

  [bold]When Deployed[/bold]

  - The deploying [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] must still command and communicate frequently with the platoon.
  - Combat should be reserved when assisting personnel in a supporting capacity, in defense of others and self, or directly leading an offensive maneuver.
  - They should avoid unnecessarily putting themselves in danger, and remain close to marines to focus on providing clear orders.
