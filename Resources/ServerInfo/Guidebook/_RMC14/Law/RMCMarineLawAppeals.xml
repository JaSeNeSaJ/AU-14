  # Right to Appeal
  - Accepting an NJP waives the right to appeal.
  - Appeals are used to correct errors, but may not be used to add new charges or punishments if a brig timer was already set.
  - Appeals must be handled before executions, demotions, and NJPs. Appealing prisoners should have their brig timers set and running while the appeal is being processed.
  - Personnel may be placed in holding awaiting their appeal if it had no brig sentence.
  - Whomever is handling the appeal has the final say in the outcome of the appeal.

  ## Appeal a Sentence in a timely manner
  If an appeal process has not started within 10 minutes, or 30 minutes for permanently brigged, after a request to appeal has been clearly communicated to any [color=#ff000d][bold]MP/Law Enforcement[/bold][/color], [color=#8B0000][bold]Officer[/bold][/color], or [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color];
  - The prisoner must be released.
  - The person whom received the request, if failing to take appropriate action, are to be given a [bold]Neglect of Duty[/bold] charge.

  ## Who can handle an appeal
  - Anyone under the jurisdiction of the UCMJ has the right to appeal their punishment to their choice of either the [color=#8B0000][bold]Acting Commander[/bold][/color] or [color=#008000][bold]High Command[/bold][/color] via fax, who may also choose to designate someone else to handle the appeal in their place. If either person picked is involved in the crimes, they should designate an uninvolved [color=#ff000d][bold]MP/Law Enforcement Officer[/bold][/color] or warrant/commissioned officer.

  Ideally, these people should not be handling the appeal;
  - Witnesses/victims.
  - Anyone who ordered the arrest.
  - The person who set the charges or punishment.

  ## Appeal outcomes
  A charge cannot be removed by appeal if the prisoner is found guilty, however, the person who handles the appeal can process the appeal as;
  - A valid charge, no modification.
  - Modify the charge to a lower charge.
  - Reduce the punishment of a charge up to the minimum punishment.
  - Remove a charge the prisoner is found innocent for.

  ## Suspending Appeals
  Appeals may be postponed in these situations;
  - Threats onboard the faction ship or base requiring immediate attention.
  - Riots or jailbreaks onboard the faction ship or base requiring immediate attention..
  - The prisoner requiring medical treatment.
  - There being an already processing appeal.
  - The prisoner having escaped or is unreachable in person.

  Appeals may not be suspended for these examples;
  - The [color=#008000][bold]Command[/bold][/color] and/or [color=#8B0000][bold]MP/Law Enforcement[/bold][/color] being busy with other tasks.
  - The prisoner being declared insane.

  ## Appeals Procedure
  - The appeal processor must be present and in person.
  - The charges should be listed along with their punishment one by one. This may be done by any [color=#ff000d][bold]MP/Law Enforcement[/bold][/color] or the appeal processor.
  - A discussion including witness accounts, the story of the accused, evidence, and mitigating circumstances is recommended.
  - If charges were applied incorrectly they must be removed. No new charges may be added as a result if a brig time has been set.
  - An appeal outcome should be given for each listed charge individually.
  - The final punishment should be for the remaining crimes.
  - The appeal processor decides the outcome. They may not be ordered or forced otherwise.
  - The appeal processor cannot be retaliated against by anyone for any part of the appeal, unless it is a neglect of duty charge due to the appeal procedure not being followed correctly.
