  # Special Provisions

  ## MP/Law Enforcement Involvement in Mutinies
  - Attempting to overthrow the legitimate command staff is illegal, and [color=#ff000d][bold]MP/Law Enforcement[/bold][/color] must do everything in their power to prevent it.
  - Should a mutiny be successful, resulting in the [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color] being deposed or surrendering, [color=#ff000d][bold]MP/Law Enforcement[/bold][/color] should remain loyal to the previous Commander.
  - The [color=#90EE90][bold]Duty Officer[/bold][/color] may be optionally skipped in the [textlink="Chain of Command" link="RMCCommandChain"], if the mutiny is successful.

  ## Emergencies
  - In emergencies, such as significant boardings or a compromised brig, imprisoned personnel may be released by the Commander, if they believe they will not be a further threat or hinderance during the emergency, also particularly if they display good behavior.
  - A simple red alert is not sufficient reason for release, unless the ship/base is significantly overrun.
