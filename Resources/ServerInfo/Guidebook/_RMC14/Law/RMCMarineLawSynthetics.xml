  ## Faction Synthetics
  - Synthetics are programmed against being able to break the UCMJ.
  - These synthetic units are also granted the same rights and privileges of regular faction personnel.
  - Synthetics not directly part of your faction do not have the above immunities.

  ## Other Synthetics
  - They may have their arrest ordered by the [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color].
  - Any of these synthetics that act against your faction such as taking valuable supplies without request, or destroying property and defenses can be declared rogue by the [color=#008000][bold]Commander[/bold][/color].
  - When declared rogue, the synthetic loses any protections and lethal force may be used freely.
